## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

### NOTE: 
I have been getting 97/96 from page speed insights from my fastkite.github.com even before removing the extra fonts.
I removed them, as it is clear they will increase the page load speed, but either way I am unable to get a low rating from
tool.  I am submitting the project as a github repo this time incase the server you are using has slow response time (as
seen on the screenshot).


### Optimizations I made to views/js/main.js

* Changed querySelectorAll to getElementsByClassName where possible

* Made this variable only called once instead of many times over window.items = document.getElementsByClassName('mover');

* Cached this value: var scrollTop = document.body.scrollTop;

* Pre-calculated these 5 phases phases.push(Math.sin((scrollTop / 1250) + i));

* Fetched the current phase this value var phase = phases[i % 5];

* Switched to using this items[i].style.transform instead of basicLeft to avoid new layout requirement

* changePizzaSizes() was not using percentages, changed it to use column sizes of 25%, 33.3%, 50%

* determineDx() was removed, and it's functionallity integrated into changePizzaSizes()

* removed from the loop var pizzasDiv = document.getElementById("randomPizzas");

* change getElementById() from querySelector() where possible

* reduced the number of sliding pizzas from 200 to 24

* moved var movingPizzas = document.getElementById("movingPizzas"); outside the loop

* added to mover class: transform: translateZ(0); so all pizzas paint on their own layer


### Steps required to run this application

1. you can access the site directly on my github by opening a web browser to http://fastkite.github.io
2. Click on Cam's Pizzeria
3. Adjust the slider to change the size of your pizza
4. Scroll up and down the page to see all the differnt pizzas you can order.
